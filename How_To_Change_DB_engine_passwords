echo "ALTER ROLE sa with PASSWORD 'correctPassword'" | /usr/local/Intelerad/3rd_Party/postgres/bin/psql -W -Usa postgres

if the SA password is unknown, edit pg_hba.conf and change the auth method from "password" to "trust" and restart postgres, you will be able to login as SA without a password.
Once you have changed the password, please remember to change the auth method back to "password"
